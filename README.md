# Tg_Benchmarking
Code and data for the paper ""Benchmarking Machine Learning Models for Polymer Informatics: An Example of Glass Transition Temperature"".

# Code
Code to compare the true Tg and predicted Tg from differnet machine learning models. 

# Data

- MD simulated 566 polymers in Dataset_2 of the paper are listed in csv file. 
- MD simulated 100 polymers in Dataset_1 of the paper are listed in excel file. 

# Model
Keras and scikit-learn models are saved into pickle files.
